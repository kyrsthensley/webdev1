        <h1>Light Roast</h1>
        <p>Light Roasts Retain Most of the Original Coffee Characteristics. Light roasts have a light brown, tan, color and lack of oil on the roasted beans. They have the highest acidity and are the brightest of the three roast levels. ... Light roasts are sometimes called Half City, Light City, New England, or Cinnamon roasts.</p>

        <h1>Medium Roast</h1>
        <p>Medium Roast coffee has a brown color that is a little darker than light roast. However, just like light roast, it does not have any oil on the surface of the beans. Instead of having delicate flavors, medium roast has a more balanced flavor, aroma, and acidity between dark and light roasts.</p>

        <h1>Dark roast</h1>
        <p>Dark Roast coffees are dark brown, even close to a blackened color. The beans are characterized by drawn-out oil that glosses the surface. Coffee made from a Dark Roast has a robust, full body. ... Some include French Roast, Italian Roast, New Orleans Roast, Continental Roast, or even Espresso Roast.</p>
